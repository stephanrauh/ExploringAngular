# ElectronPlaysChess2025

This is a very old project, dating back to the alpha versions of Angular 2.0. Every once in a while, I update it to contemporary Angular. This way, I see what's changed over the last couple of versions.

Right now (January 14th, 2025), the project compiles and runs with Angular 19. But only by a margin. There are weird rendering issues and the application is remarkably slow. Plus, the programming style is what we used to do in Angular 7 - or probably even earlier...

Cutting a long story short: this project is work in progress!
